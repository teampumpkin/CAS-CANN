Design a clean, modern, and accessible website for the Canadian Amyloidosis Society (CAS). The site is focused on patient-first communication, clinician access to verified resources, and community engagement.

Ignore content and page structure — focus only on the visual style, animations, UI effects, micro-interactions, and accessibility.

🔷 Brand & Tone:
	•	Calm, professional, and trustworthy
	•	Designed for diverse audiences — patients, caregivers, clinicians
	•	Incorporate CAS brand colors:
	•	Primary: #00AFE6 (blue), #00DD89 (green)
	•	Logo style should inspire font and color choices sitewide

🎨 Visual Design Style:
	•	Use a Minimalist + Flat 2.0 hybrid approach
	•	Spacious layout with clear hierarchy and soft section breaks
	•	Rounded cards with gentle shadows
	•	Modern sans-serif typography (e.g., Inter, DM Sans)
	•	Use soft gradients or lightly tinted backgrounds to separate sections
	•	Icons only when necessary for clarity — keep interface clean and content-first

🧭 Navigation Behavior:
	•	Persistent top navigation with dropdowns
	•	Logo remains fixed and clickable at all times
	•	Collapsible mobile menu with slide-in behavior
	•	Homepage uses bold, tile-based navigation for key sections

⚙️ Animations & Effects:
	•	Section transitions: scroll-triggered fade-in, slide-up, or light zoom-in
	•	Hero or background images may use subtle parallax on desktop
	•	Sticky call-to-action (CTA) button animates in after scroll threshold
	•	Button hover: slight scale and soft glow or border highlight
	•	Card hover: gentle lift with shadow and slight background tint
	•	Accordion-style transitions for FAQs or expandable sections
	•	Smooth scroll on internal link navigation

🤏 Micro-Interactions:
	•	Form fields: highlight border or glow on focus
	•	Upload & Filter tags: animated state change with clarity and contrast
	•	Error/success messages: soft slide-in transitions
	•	Clickable tiles: scale-in effect with slight bounce or glow on tap
	•	Navigation links: animated underline or color fade on hover

♿ Accessibility Considerations:
	•	High contrast color pairings
	•	Responsive layout with generous spacing and scalable font sizes
	•	Fully keyboard-navigable: menus, forms, buttons
	•	Alt text required for all images/icons
	•	Clear focus indicators for all interactive elements
	•	Link text must use both color and underline for clarity

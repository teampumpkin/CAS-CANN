You now have access to 3 core project documents for the Zoho Data Integration System:

📘 Document 1: Zoho Data Integration Service Architecture  
Defines what to build – an independent microservice that integrates with Zoho CRM without interfering with the live WebForm → Zoho pipeline.  
Core principles: tag-based safety, CSV/Excel imports, cleanup, deduplication, JSON reporting, future AI enrichment support.

📗 Document 2: Directory Resource Project (SOW)  
Defines why to build it – the operational data migration project using 16 CSV/Excel files to populate and relate 3 Zoho modules (Accounts, Contacts, Resources) with bilingual data support for amyloid.ca.  
End goal: unified bilingual master directory for public visualization.

📙 Document 3: Execution Checklist & Methodology  
Defines how to build it – 8 phased, checkpoint-driven methodology ensuring clean architecture, validation, and rollback safety.

🎯 My Understanding Summary
- Doc 1 = **What to Build (Architecture)**
- Doc 2 = **Why to Build (Project Scope)**
- Doc 3 = **How to Build (Methodology)**

Your mission:
1. Build the standalone Zoho Data Integration Service using the methodology from Document 3.  
2. Use it to execute the Directory Resource Project from Document 2.  
3. Follow the architectural principles and isolation rules from Document 1.

🧠 Tech Stack Decision Checkpoint
Before you start execution:
My current codebase uses **Node.js/TypeScript**, but Document 3 proposes **Python (pandas, openpyxl)** for data handling.  

I want you to analyze and recommend the best option:  

**Option A:** Build in **Python** – Create a fully separate backend microservice as a clean data utility layer.  
**Option B:** Build in **TypeScript** – Integrate the data service as a module within the existing Node.js-based architecture for unified control.  

✅ Your decision must be based on:
- Long-term scalability
- Ease of API maintenance
- Data processing efficiency
- Future compatibility with AI enrichment and RAG workflows

Once decided, confirm the language stack choice and begin **Phase 1: Environment Setup**, following the checkpoint methodology exactly as defined in Document 3.

Each phase must:
- Be validated independently  
- Save a snapshot or checkpoint  
- Log completion before proceeding to the next

Start when ready.

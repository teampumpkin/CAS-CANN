## Theme Architecture

### Single Environment Approach
The application uses a unified theme system rather than separate environments for light and dark modes. This approach provides:

**Benefits:**
- Single codebase with consistent component structure
- Automatic theme switching based on user preference
- CSS variables for dynamic theme values
- Tailwind's built-in dark mode support with `dark:` prefixes
- Better maintainability and performance

**Implementation:**
- CSS variables defined in `:root` (light) and `.dark` (dark) classes
- ThemeProvider component for state management and persistence
- Theme utility functions for consistent styling patterns
- Brand-consistent colors and gradients across both themes

**Why Not Separate Environments:**
- Would require code duplication and maintenance overhead
- Could lead to inconsistent behavior between themes
- More complex testing and deployment processes
- Harder to ensure feature parity across themes

The current approach follows industry best practices and provides a robust, scalable theming solution.

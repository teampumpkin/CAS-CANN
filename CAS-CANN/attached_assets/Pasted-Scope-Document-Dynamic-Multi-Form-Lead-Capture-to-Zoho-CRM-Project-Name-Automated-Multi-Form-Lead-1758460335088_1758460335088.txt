Scope Document: Dynamic Multi-Form Lead Capture to Zoho CRM
Project Name:

Automated Multi-Form Lead Capture & CRM Sync (Website → Zoho CRM)

1. Objective

Capture leads from any form on the website automatically.

Push all submissions to Zoho CRM Leads module (or other modules dynamically).

Automatically create missing fields in Zoho CRM — no manual work required.

Label every lead with the source form name for tracking and reporting.

Handle all field types: text, email, phone, picklist, multi-select, boolean.

Provide logging and error tracking for monitoring submissions.

2. Key Features
2.1 Dynamic Form Integration

Accept submissions from any website form via a single endpoint.

Form submissions include:

Form name (unique identifier)

All fields (dynamic; any number or type)

Supports adding new forms anytime without code changes.

2.2 Automated Field Management

Fetch all existing fields from Zoho CRM via Metadata API.

Compare incoming form fields with existing CRM fields.

Automatically create missing fields:

Text for free-text inputs

Picklist for dropdowns

Multi-select for checkboxes

Boolean for Yes/No fields

2.3 Data Push to Zoho CRM

Use Core API to push data into Leads module or dynamically assigned module.

Include a Source_Form field for each lead.

Handles:

Single value fields

Multi-select arrays

Picklist mapping

2.4 Logging & Monitoring

Log every submission (success or failure) in backend console or file.

Retry mechanism for failed Zoho API calls.

Optional: Email alerts on repeated failures.

2.5 Multi-Form Scalability

Any new website form can be integrated by submitting its form_name and data.

No backend code changes required for new forms.

Optional configuration JSON to map forms to different Zoho modules.

3. Technical Architecture
[Website Forms] 
     ↓ (form submission)
[Replit Backend / API Server]
     ↓
[Dynamic Field Sync Engine] → Zoho Metadata API
     ↓
[Data Push Engine] → Zoho Core API (Leads/Other Modules)
     ↓
[Logging / Monitoring]


Components:

Website Forms:

HTML forms on your Replit-hosted website.

Must include form_name in submission.

Replit Backend/API Server:

Node.js server endpoint /submit-form.

Accepts any form submission dynamically.

Processes fields, syncs with CRM, pushes data.

Dynamic Field Sync Engine:

Fetches fields from Zoho CRM.

Creates missing fields automatically via Metadata API.

Data Push Engine:

Sends the submission to Zoho using Core API.

Includes Source_Form field for tracking.

Logging & Monitoring:

Tracks success/failure of submissions.

Retry mechanism for failed API calls.

4. Data Flow Example

Form Submission Example:

{
  "form_name": "Join CANN Today",
  "data": {
    "Full Name": "Jane Doe",
    "Email": "jane@example.com",
    "Professional Designation": "Nurse Clinician",
    "Sub-specialty Focus": "Cardiology",
    "Amyloidosis Patient Type": "ATTR",
    "Institution Name": "Heart Care Center",
    "Communication Consent": "Yes",
    "Educational Interests": [
      "Mental health considerations for amyloidosis",
      "Case presentations/discussion"
    ],
    "Presentation Opportunity": "No"
  }
}


Backend Process:

Detect form_name → "Join CANN Today".

Fetch existing CRM fields → compare with form data.

Create missing fields automatically.

Add Source_Form = "Join CANN Today".

Push data to Zoho Leads module.

Log success/failure.

5. Environment & Configuration
.env
ZOHO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_zoho_oauth_token
ZOHO_ORG_ID=your_zoho_org_id
DEFAULT_MODULE=Leads

Optional Form-Module Mapping
{
  "Join CANN Today": { "module": "Leads" },
  "Another Form": { "module": "Contacts" }
}

--- ABOUT AMYLOIDOSIS SECTION ---
Badge: Medical Information
Title: What is Amyloidosis
Subtitle: Amyloidosis is a rare disease with life-altering consequences—but early detection can dramatically improve outcomes. The Canadian Amyloidosis Society is building a trusted national hub for clinicians, researchers, and families seeking answers.

Description: Amyloidosis is a rare but serious condition where misfolded proteins (amyloid) accumulate in organs and tissues throughout the body. Understanding the different types, recognizing early symptoms, and accessing specialized care are crucial for managing this condition effectively.

Early Detection Section:
Title: Early Detection
Subtitle: Saves Lives
Description: Amyloidosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because its symptoms mimic other conditions. Early recognition and proper testing are crucial for better patient outcomes.
Sub-description: Our directory connects patients with specialized centers and healthcare providers experienced in diagnosing and treating amyloidosis across Canada.

Types of Amyloidosis:
1. AL Amyloidosis
   - Most common form, affects heart, kidneys, liver, and nervous system
   - 70% of cases

2. AA Amyloidosis  
   - Secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions
   - 20% of cases

3. Hereditary
   - Genetic forms including TTR, fibrinogen, and lysozyme
   - 5% of cases

4. Other Types

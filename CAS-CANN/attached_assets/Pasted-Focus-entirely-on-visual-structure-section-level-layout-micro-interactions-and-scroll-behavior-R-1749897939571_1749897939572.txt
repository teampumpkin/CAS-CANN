Focus entirely on visual structure, section-level layout, micro-interactions, and scroll behavior. Recreate the overall feel of Crawford’s site, adapted for a nonprofit health awareness brand.

🔷 Design Identity:
	•	Style: Minimalist + Soft Flat 2.0, with a light neumorphic layer feel
	•	Grid-based layout with wide gutters and padded, centered content blocks
	•	Each section should feel like an individual, softly elevated card
	•	Avoid overuse of icons or decoration — simplicity and typography lead

🎨 Color & Branding:
	•	Use CAS primary brand colors only as accents:
	•	#00AFE6 (blue) and #00DD89 (green)
	•	Backgrounds: mostly white or light gray (#F8F9FA, #FAFBFC)
	•	Subtle gradients only where necessary (e.g. buttons, hover states)

🧱 Components & Surfaces (Match Crawford Style):
	•	Rounded cards with soft shadows (box-shadow in blur not hard drop)
	•	Buttons: pill-shaped, medium-large, brand-accented with soft shadows
	•	Content sections: center-aligned, max-width of 1140px
	•	Spacing: 64px–96px between sections, maintain calm breathing room

✨ Scroll & Animations:
	•	Use fade-in-up or fade-in-zoom for section reveals
	•	Navigation bar should be sticky and fade-in on scroll
	•	Card hover: light lift with background tint or outline glow
	•	Button hover: soft zoom-in with brand color fill or glow
	•	Smooth transitions between sliders or carousels (if present)
	•	Subtle parallax on large banners (desktop only)

🤏 Micro-Interactions:
	•	On hover: tiles lift slightly, text shifts upward a few pixels
	•	On focus: form inputs use animated underline or border glow
	•	Navigation hover: underline expands smoothly from center
	•	Quick link tiles (e.g. “Join CAS”, “Find Support”) animate softly on hover

♿ Accessibility:
	•	Ensure high color contrast between text and background
	•	All sections should be keyboard navigable
	•	Use clearly distinguishable focus rings
	•	Maintain font size of at least 18px for body text
	•	Avoid purely color-based cues for actions

📱 Responsive Behavior:
	•	Hero images resize or shift below text on smaller screens
	•	Tiles become stacked with padding on mobile
	•	Navigation collapses into icon menu with smooth slide-out
	•	Use vertical spacing to preserve the visual calm on narrow breakpoints

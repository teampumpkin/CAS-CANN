#### Request JSON Keys

- idstring, mandatory



Specify the unique ID of the record that you want to update. Refer to [Get Records API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/get-records.html) to get the unique ID of the record.

- $append\_valuesJSON object, optional



Determines whether to append or replace values in a multi-select picklist when updating a record.



**Usage:**



- Specify the **API names** of the multi-select picklists as keys.
- Set the value to **"true"** to **append** new values to the existing ones.
- Set the value to **"false"** to **replace** existing values with the new ones.

Note that the values are appended or replaced only for those records that have this key in the input. For the other multi-select picklists, the existing values are simply replaced by default.

- skip\_feature\_executionJSON array, optional



By default, if a Cadence is configured for a module, it will be executed automatically when you update a record via API. This key lets you **skip the execution of the Cadences feature** during record updates.

Specify **"cadences"** as the value for the **"name"** key to skip Cadences execution for the record. Ensure you include this key alongside the **"data"** key in your request. The supported value for the **"name"** key is **"cadences"**.


**Note**

- The "INVALID\_DATA" error is thrown if the **field value length** is more than the maximum length defined for that field.
- If an API is used inside a Function and the field value exceeds the allowed length, the function will receive an error response from the API.
  - For example, if a Text field has a maximum length of **10**, the API cannot accept a value like **"12345678901"**, since it exceeds the limit with **11** characters.
- A maximum of **100** records can be **updated** per API call.
- Duplicates are checked for every update record API call based on **unique** fields.
- You must use only Field API names in the input. You can obtain the field API names from:
  - [Fields metadata API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/field-meta.html) (the value for the key “api\_name” for every field). (Or)
  - **Setup** \> **Developer Hub** \> **APIs and SDKs** \> **API Names** \> **{{Module}}**. Choose “Fields” from the “Filter By” drop-down.
- Records with **Subform** details can also be updated to CRM using the Records API. Please look at [Subforms API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/update-subforms.html) to learn more about updating subform information within a record. For detailed information on subforms, refer to our [Kaizen](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/kaizen-series-directory.html?category=API) post : [Manipulating Subform using Zoho CRM APIs](https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/community/topic/kaizen-124-accessing-subform-using-zoho-crm-apis).
- If the update API calls for a record are from DRE(Functions), due to workflow triggered on the same record's create/update, workflow alone will not get executed, irrespective of the trigger param configuration.
- Use the "\_delete" key to delete data from multi-select lookup, multi-user lookup, and image upload fields. You must pass the record ID created in the linking module in your input. Refer to the sample input for details.
- All records that are updated will enter the review process by default.
- You can also use the sample response of each module as the input when you insert, update, or upsert a record in that corresponding module.
- Refer to the [Get Records API](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/get-records.html) to know more about field types and limits.
- You can update all fields in a module that are supported in the [insert records](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/insert-records.html) operation.
- You must provide the layout ID field if you want to
  - include the layout specific mandatory fields in the API-level mandatory check
  - include only the fields that are defined in your layout for API- level processing and ignore the rest
- Multiselect Lookup association is restricted if the dependent record is locked, and the system will throw a **RECORD\_LOCKED** error.
- In calls module, the call duration for an Inbound or Outbound call cannot be zero.

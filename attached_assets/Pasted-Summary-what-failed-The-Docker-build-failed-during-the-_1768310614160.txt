Summary — what failed
- The Docker build failed during the npm run build step. Docker exited with code 1 because the build tool (esbuild) reported unresolved imports and aborted:
  - Could not resolve "./migrations/fix-auto-create-fields"
  - Could not resolve "./form-config-engine"
- Those errors originate from server/index.ts (shown in the log). Because esbuild couldn't find those modules, the build command failed and the Docker build stopped.

What "Could not resolve" means
- The bundler (esbuild) tried to find and bundle the two modules you import from server/index.ts but could not locate the files at the given paths. This is effectively a "module not found" error during bundling.

Most likely causes and how to check/fix each
1) The files are missing from the repository or wrong path
   - Check that the files actually exist at the exact relative paths referenced:
     - server/migrations/fix-auto-create-fields.(ts|js)
     - server/form-config-engine.(ts|js)
   - Command locally: from repo root run
     - grep -R "fix-auto-create-fields" -n .
     - grep -R "form-config-engine" -n .
     - ls -la server/migrations
     - ls -la server
   - If files are missing, add them or fix the import path.

2) Case sensitivity mismatch
   - CI runners are Linux (case-sensitive). If filenames differ only by case (e.g., Form-Config-Engine.ts vs form-config-engine.ts), it will work on macOS/Windows locally but fail in CI. Fix filename or import to match exactly.

3) Files are excluded from Docker build context (COPY/.dockerignore)
   - Common issue: Dockerfile copies only package.json and runs npm ci, then later COPY . . is missing or .dockerignore excludes the server or migrations directories. Confirm your Dockerfile includes the relevant source files into the image before running npm run build.
   - Inspect .dockerignore to ensure it doesn't exclude server/ or migrations/.
   - Typical safe Dockerfile pattern:
     - COPY package*.json ./
     - RUN npm ci
     - COPY . .
     - RUN npm run build

4) TypeScript path alias / build config not handled by esbuild
   - If you're using tsconfig path aliases (like @server/...), esbuild won't resolve them unless configured. Make sure imports are relative or configure esbuild to handle aliases (or run tsc first).
   - If you rely on compiled output (dist/...), ensure the build step knows where the sources are.

5) Import uses a different extension or compiled file
   - If the import expects a compiled .js file but the source files are .ts and not compiled yet, ensure the bundler configuration resolves .ts or you compile with tsc first.

How to reproduce and debug locally
- Run the same build locally to reproduce the error:
  - npm ci
  - npm run build
- Inspect server/index.ts around the reported lines (64 and 80) to see the exact import statements:
  - sed -n '1,140p' server/index.ts | nl -ba | sed -n '60,90p'

What to do next (quick checklist)
1. Verify the files exist at the exact paths referenced.
2. Confirm names and case exactly match imports.
3. Confirm Dockerfile copies the source before building and that .dockerignore doesn’t exclude files.
4. If you use path aliases, either adapt esbuild or use tsc first / set up plugins.
5. Run npm run build locally to see the same errors and iterate until esbuild can resolve them.

If you want, I can:
- Search your repository for those filenames and show you where (or whether) they exist.
- Inspect your Dockerfile and .dockerignore to see if files are being copied into the build context.

Perfect 👍 — you already have Zoho CRM integrated with your website forms (so live form data already flows into Zoho).
Now you want to **create a *separate, non-breaking data integration service*** that:

* Runs independently from the existing website form submission pipeline,
* Interacts via **Replit Agent**,
* Uses **Zoho CRM API** for **data cleanup, transformation, and uploading**,
* And can evolve into a **standalone backend service** for future automation.

Here’s a **ready-to-use structured prompt** for your **Replit Dev Agent** to set that up correctly:

### 🧠 Prompt for Replit Dev Agent — "Zoho Data Integration Service (Non-breaking)"

````
You are a development automation agent with access to my Replit workspace. 
Your goal is to create an independent Zoho CRM API integration service for data import, cleanup, and upload — without interfering with the existing Zoho integration connected to my website forms.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Set up a new **standalone service** (microservice or script) called `zoho-data-sync-service` that:
- Connects to my existing **Zoho CRM API credentials** (OAuth2 access + refresh token).
- Reads, cleans, and uploads structured datasets (CSV/Excel) into Zoho CRM.
- Works in parallel with the current live form submission → Zoho CRM integration pipeline, **without overwriting or breaking it**.
- Prepares foundation for future data cleanup, deduplication, and enrichment automation.

---

## 🧩 Key Functional Requirements

1. **Architecture Setup**
   - Create a separate service folder inside Replit: `/services/zoho-data-sync/`
   - Use `Python` or `Node.js` depending on your setup preference.
   - Load environment variables from `.env` file (tokens, keys, etc.)
   - Maintain modular structure for future extensions:
     ```
     /services/zoho-data-sync/
       ├── auth/
       ├── modules/
       ├── uploads/
       ├── cleanup/
       ├── utils/
       ├── logs/
       ├── main.py (or index.js)
     ```

2. **API Connection Layer**
   - Reuse existing Zoho OAuth credentials.
   - Use the **Zoho CRM v3 API** base URL:
     ```
     https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v3/
     ```
   - Implement auto token refresh using stored refresh token.
   - Use headers:
     ```
     Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken <access_token>
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

3. **Pipeline Scope**
   - Service should support these core modules:
     - `Accounts` (Institutions)
     - `Contacts` (Members)
     - `Resources` (Custom Module)
   - Include helper scripts for:
     - **Data cleaning** (normalize fields, fix duplicates)
     - **Bulk upload** using `/bulk/v2/write`
     - **Upsert** logic (deduplication via `Institution_ID` or `Email`)
     - **Record linking** (Contacts → Accounts, Resources → Accounts)

4. **Non-Interference Rule**
   - This pipeline must not alter or overwrite the existing CRM entries created via live form submissions.
   - Implement safety logic:
     - Only modify records with a tag `"DataSync"` or `"BatchImport"`.
     - Never touch records with `"WebForm"` tag.
     - Add `source_tag = "DataSyncService"` for tracking.

5. **Data Import Handling**
   - Accept structured `.csv` or `.xlsx` uploads.
   - Read and clean using `pandas` (Python) or `csv-parser/xlsx` (Node.js).
   - Generate logs and reports after each import.
   - Maintain backup of imported data and responses.

6. **Interaction with Replit Agent**
   - Allow me to trigger actions using natural commands like:
     - “Clean and upload membership data file.”
     - “Check duplicates in Institutions.”
     - “Push new Resources dataset to Zoho.”
   - You should parse my intent, locate the right script, and execute the task.
   - Return a summary report like:
     ```json
     {
       "accounts_imported": 450,
       "contacts_cleaned": 920,
       "duplicates_skipped": 22,
       "upload_status": "success",
       "linked_records": 865
     }
     ```

7. **Future Integration Hooks**
   - Keep structure open for future connectors:
     - HubSpot, Intercom, or RAG-based data enrichment.
     - Breeze AI or internal enrichment services.
   - Prepare a `/enrich/` module placeholder for AI-powered cleanup.

## 🧰 Tech Dependencies
**Language:** Python 3.11+ (preferred) or Node.js 18+  
**Libraries (Python):**
````

requests
pandas
python-dotenv
openpyxl

```

**Libraries (Node.js):**
```

axios
csv-parser
xlsx
dotenv

```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan
- Step 1: Create `.env` file with existing Zoho tokens (ACCESS + REFRESH).
- Step 2: Build `auth/zoho_auth.py` (or `.js`) to handle token refresh.
- Step 3: Create a module handler for each CRM module (Accounts, Contacts, Resources).
- Step 4: Implement safe upsert + tag filtering.
- Step 5: Test locally on sample CSV.
- Step 6: Generate log reports and confirm no interference with live form flow.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
When complete, the service should:
- Allow independent data upload & cleanup via command or Replit agent prompt.
- Tag new/updated records distinctly (`DataSyncService`).
- Keep form submission integration intact.
- Be easily expandable for AI enrichment and cross-CRM data matching later.
```

Would you like me to now add the **follow-up command set** you can use directly in Replit chat (like `/run import contacts`, `/run clean accounts`, etc.) — so your agent can interpret and execute actions conversationally?

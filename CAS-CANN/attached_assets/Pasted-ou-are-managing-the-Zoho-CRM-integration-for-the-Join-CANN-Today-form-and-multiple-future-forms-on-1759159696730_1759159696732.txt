ou are managing the Zoho CRM integration for the “Join CANN Today” form and multiple future forms on our website. The current setup is partially working — forms are submitted, stored in the database, and processed through a pipeline with field mapping, retry logic, and audit logging. OAuth token management is implemented but expired tokens are blocking the final push to Zoho CRM.

Your tasks are as follows:

OAuth Module Enhancements

Implement automatic token refresh to ensure expired tokens never block the pipeline.

Verify that token expiry is proactively checked before pushing data to Zoho CRM.

Ensure OAuth redirect and callback flows are fully functional for server-based app registration.

CRM Push Module

Complete the push to Zoho CRM (/crm/v3/Leads and /crm/v3/Contacts) once OAuth is active.

Map all webform fields, including custom fields (Amyloidosis Type, Educational Interests, Communication Preferences, etc.) to CRM fields dynamically.

Store Zoho record IDs back into the database for traceability.

Field Metadata Module

Cache Zoho CRM field metadata locally to reduce repeated API calls.

Implement auto-refresh for metadata at least once a day to accommodate future new fields.

Reporting Module

Implement /api/reports endpoint to fetch aggregated lead data.

Integrate Zoho Query API (COQL) to generate reports showing all fields from CRM.

Ensure reports can filter by form source, date range, or lead status.

Notification Module

Implement a weekly summary notification system for clients.

Include total leads, new submissions, and CSV/Excel export of submissions.

Optionally, implement real-time alert notifications using Zoho Notification API for lead changes.

Scalability / Dynamic Forms Module

Ensure any new form added to the website can be automatically processed with existing pipeline.

Assign a unique form source label to each submission for tracking.

Error Handling & Retry Enhancements

Ensure failed submissions due to OAuth errors or API rate limits are retried automatically.

Maintain comprehensive audit logs for every action, including retries, failures, and successes.

Deliverables:

Fully functioning OAuth flow with auto-refresh.

Real-time push of form submissions to Zoho CRM Leads and Contacts.

Complete reporting endpoint with all CRM fields included.

Weekly client notification system.

Fully scalable dynamic form integration.

**Complete Content Implementation**:
```
Badge: "Medical Information"
Title: "What is Amyloidosis"
Subtitle: "Amyloidosis is a rare disease with life-altering consequences—but early detection can dramatically improve outcomes. The Canadian Amyloidosis Society is building a trusted national hub for clinicians, researchers, and families seeking answers."

Main Description: "Amyloidosis is a rare but serious condition where misfolded proteins (amyloid) accumulate in organs and tissues throughout the body. Understanding the different types, recognizing early symptoms, and accessing specialized care are crucial for managing this condition effectively."

Early Detection Card:
Title: "Early Detection - Saves Lives"
Description: "Amyloidosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because its symptoms mimic other conditions. Early recognition and proper testing are crucial for better patient outcomes."
Additional: "Our directory connects patients with specialized centers and healthcare providers experienced in diagnosing and treating amyloidosis across Canada."

## About Amyloidosis Page Visual Documentation

### Hero Section
**Design**: Full-screen medical hero with professional focus

**Complete Content Implementation**:
```
Badge: "Medical Information"
Title: "Understanding Amyloidosis"
Subtitle: "Learn the signs, understand the types, and take action early."
Description: "Amyloidosis is a rare but serious disease where misfolded proteins accumulate in organs. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly improve outcomes."
Target Audience: PCPs, cardiologists, neurologists, nephrologists, hematologists
Buttons: "Get Started", "Browse Directory"
```

### Simplified Pathophysiology Section
**Design**: Step-by-step visual process explanation

**Complete Content Implementation**:
```
Title: "Pathophysiology"
Description: "Amyloidosis occurs when proteins misfold and accumulate in tissues."
Detailed Explanation: "When proteins misfold, they can form fibril deposits called amyloid that accumulate in various organs and tissues, disrupting normal function and potentially leading to organ failure if left untreated."

Simple Visual Process:
Step 1: Healthy Proteins → Proteins maintain their proper shape and function normally
Step 2: Protein Misfolding → Proteins lose their proper shape and can't work correctly
Step 3: Amyloid Buildup → Misfolded proteins clump together in organs, causing problems

Key Takeaway: "Amyloidosis isn't a single disease—it's a group of conditions caused by different proteins folding incorrectly. The type depends on which protein is misfolding and where it accumulates in your body."
```

### Warning Signs Section
**Design**: Five symptom category cards with icons

### Types of Amyloidosis Section
**Design**: Expandable cards with comprehensive medical information

**Complete Content Implementation**:
```
Title: "Types of Amyloidosis"
Subtitle: "Major forms and their characteristics."
Introduction: "Each type is named with 'A' followed by the protein responsible. For example: AL Amyloidosis (from light chain proteins), ATTR Amyloidosis (from transthyretin protein), AA, ALECT2, Aβ2M, and other rare forms."

Three Expandable Type Cards:

1. AL (LIGHT-CHAIN) AMYLOIDOSIS
   Subtitle: "Caused by abnormal plasma cells producing light chains"
   Prevalence: "Often diagnosed after age 50; affects both men and women"
   Disease Context: "Related to multiple myeloma (10-15% overlap)"
   
   Symptoms:
   • Leg swelling • Fatigue • Irregular heartbeat
   • Enlarged tongue • Skin changes (bruising, purple patches around eyes)
   
   Diagnosis Methods:
   • Tissue biopsy • Blood/urine tests for light chains • Bone marrow biopsy
   • Imaging tests (ECG, MRI, echocardiogram)
   
   Treatment Options:
   • Chemotherapy • Steroids • Proteasome inhibitors • Monoclonal antibodies
   • Stem cell transplant (in select cases) • Supportive care to manage symptoms and organ function
   
   Key Point: "Target abnormal plasma cells with various therapies"

2. ATTR (TRANSTHYRETIN) AMYLOIDOSIS
   Subtitle: "Two forms: Hereditary (hATTR) and Wild-type (ATTRwt)"
   Prevalence: "hATTR: Over 120 TTR mutations known"
   Disease Context: "ATTRwt: Non-inherited, develops with age, primarily affects men over 60"
   
   Symptoms:
   • Heart issues: palpitations, fainting, fatigue
   • Nerve issues: numbness, walking difficulty
   • GI symptoms: nausea, weight loss
   
   Diagnosis Methods:
   • Genetic testing for TTR mutations • Biopsies, imaging (MRI, scans) • Protein testing
   
   Treatment Options:
   • TTR stabilizers: Tafamidis (Vyndaqel), Acoramidis (Attruby)
   • Gene silencers: Patisiran (Onpattro), Vutrisiran (Amvuttra)
   • Supportive care for symptoms and organ protection
   
   Key Point: "Wild-type often causes heart failure and carpal tunnel syndrome"

3. RARE TYPES OF AMYLOIDOSIS
   Subtitle: "AA, ALECT2, Aβ2M, and other rare forms"
   Prevalence: "Variable prevalence by geographic and ethnic background"
   Disease Context: "Different underlying causes and affected organs"
   
   Symptoms:
   • AA: Linked to long-standing inflammation, mostly affects kidneys
   • ALECT2: More common in Mexican, Punjabi, Native American, Middle Eastern descent
   • Aβ2M: Seen in long-term dialysis patients, affects bones and joints
   
   Diagnosis Methods:
   • Biopsies, blood and urine analysis • Imaging: ECG, MRI, echocardiograms
   • Genetic testing for hereditary types • Specialized testing: mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry
   
   Treatment Options:
   • AA: Treat underlying disease to reduce SAA protein
   • ALECT2: Often underdiagnosed, mainly affects kidneys
   • Aβ2M: Becoming rarer due to improved dialysis techniques
   • Supportive care and research ongoing for most types
   
   Key Point: "Early diagnosis is critical for better outcomes"
```

### Diagnostic Pathway Section
**Design**: Sequential step-by-step approach

**Complete Content Implementation**:

You have 12 Excel files in the attached_assets folder. Your mission is to process them all **directly via script**, importing into the correct Zoho modules. Follow the steps below:

1️⃣ **File-to-Module Mapping**  
- Accounts (Institutions / Clinics / Hospitals): Files 1, 2, 5, 6, 8  
- Contacts (Members / HCPs): Files 3, 4, 9  
- Resources (Documents / Forms / Guides): File 5 (Resources sheet), File 7  

2️⃣ **Processing Rules**  
- Start with a **dry run** for every file first, to validate data and relationships.  
- Apply data cleanup automatically:  
  - Deduplicate by email (Contacts)  
  - Normalize names, phone numbers, postal codes  
  - Map bilingual fields correctly (EN/FR)  
- Use `Institution_ID` to link Contacts and Resources to Accounts.  
- Skip any records tagged as “WebForm” to avoid interfering with live Zoho pipelines.  
- Save a **checkpoint/log** after each file’s dry run.  

3️⃣ **Execution Flow**  
For each file (1-12):  
- Dry run first: validate, clean, show summary (records to create, duplicates, invalids)  
- Once dry run is ✅, perform live import into the correct module  
- Log results and save a checkpoint after live import  

4️⃣ **Reporting**  
After all 12 files are processed, produce a **master JSON report** including:  
- Total records processed per module  
- Records successfully created  
- Records skipped / duplicates / invalid  
- Any errors encountered  

5️⃣ **Manual Steps for Resources (Phase 5)**  
- After Resource records are created, provide a **list of files to attach manually** in Zoho (PDFs or other assets), linked to the correct `Institution_ID`.  

6️⃣ **Bilingual Support**  
- Ensure all field labels and dropdowns support English and French where applicable.  

7️⃣ **Safety Rules**  
- Never touch live WebForm records  
- Auto-rollback on failure  
- Validate relationships (Contacts → Accounts, Resources → Accounts)  

🚀 **Start processing** the files in this sequence:  
1, 2, 5, 6, 8 → Accounts  
3, 4, 9 → Contacts  
5 (Resources sheet), 7 → Resources  

After each file, output a **summary of the dry run** and **live import** results. Confirm before moving to the next file.

The job is failing due to the following error during the AWS ECS deployment step:

```
An error occurred (ServiceNotFoundException) when calling the UpdateService operation:
Process completed with exit code 254.
```

**Root Cause**
- The AWS CLI returned a `ServiceNotFoundException` when trying to update the ECS service. This means the ECS service name referenced in your deployment step does not exist in the specified cluster/region.

**Solution**
1. **Verify Service Name and Cluster**
   - Double-check the service name and cluster used in your deploy step (likely in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
   - Make sure the ECS service is created and exists in your AWS account in the `ap-south-1` region.

2. **Update the Workflow File**
   - If the service name in `deploy.yml` is incorrect, update it to the correct ECS service name.
   - Example snippet where you should check/change:
     ```yaml
     - name: Deploy to ECS
       run: |
         aws ecs update-service --cluster myCluster --service myService --force-new-deployment
     ```
     Replace `myCluster` and `myService` with names that exist in your AWS console.

3. **Check AWS Credentials and Permissions**
   - Ensure the IAM user/role used has permissions for `ecs:UpdateService`.

**Suggested Code Change**
Update your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to reference the correct ECS service name, for example:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to ECS
  run: |
    aws ecs update-service \
      --cluster <correct-cluster-name> \
      --service <correct-service-name> \
      --force-new-deployment
```
Replace `<correct-cluster-name>` and `<correct-service-name>` with valid existing values.

**Next Steps**
- Go to your AWS ECS console in `ap-south-1` and verify your cluster and service exist.
- Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to use the correct names.
- Re-run the workflow.

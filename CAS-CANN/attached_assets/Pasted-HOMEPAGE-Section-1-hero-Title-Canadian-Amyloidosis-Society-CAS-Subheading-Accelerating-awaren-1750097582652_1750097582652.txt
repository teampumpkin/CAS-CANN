 Section 2: 
Welcome to the Canadian Amyloidosis Society (CAS) We are dedicated to transforming amyloidosis care in Canada through patient-centered innovation, collaboration, and advocacy. Our mission is to enhance the quality and timeliness of care for individuals affected by this rare and complex disease. By accelerating access to diagnosis, treatment, and support, we are working to ensure that every person living with amyloidosis receives the care they need—when they need it, wherever they are in Canada. 
 Section 3: 
What is Amyloidosis?
Amyloidosis is a rare disease with life-altering consequences—but early detection can dramatically improve outcomes. The Canadian Amyloidosis Society is building a trusted national hub for clinicians, researchers, and families seeking answers.

ABOUT AMYLOIDOSIS PAGE
Header Learn the signs, understand the types, and take action early. 
Overview Amyloidosis is a group of rare diseases caused by abnormal protein buildup (amyloid) in the body. These deposits can damage organs and tissues, leading to serious health complications. Because symptoms often mimic other conditions, diagnosis is frequently delayed. 
Why It Matters Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve quality of life and outcomes. Understanding the signs—and acting on them—is key.
Amyloidosis Types and Clinical Pathways Each subtype affects different organs and may require distinct treatment approaches. Below are summaries of the most common forms:
1. AL (Light-Chain) Amyloidosis
· Signs & Symptoms: Fatigue, swelling (especially legs), numbness, irregular heartbeat, enlarged tongue
· Diagnosis & Testing: Blood and urine tests (free light chains), biopsy, cardiac imaging, bone marrow biopsy
· Treatment: Chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, supportive organ care
 
2. ATTR (Transthyretin) Amyloidosis – Hereditary and Wild-Type
· Signs & Symptoms: Heart failure, peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal issues, carpal tunnel syndrome
· Diagnosis & Testing: Genetic testing (for hereditary), scintigraphy, cardiac MRI, tissue biopsy
· Treatment: TTR stabilizers (tafamidis), gene silencers, cardiac therapies, supportive care
3. AA (Secondary) Amyloidosis
· Signs & Symptoms: Kidney dysfunction, joint pain, fatigue
· Diagnosis & Testing: SAA blood levels, kidney or fat pad biopsy
· Treatment: Address underlying inflammatory condition (e.g., RA, infections), anti-inflammatory biologics
4. Other Types (Localized, Dialysis-Related, Rare Mutations)
· Treatment varies widely based on type, organ impact, and cause

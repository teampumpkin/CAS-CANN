About Amyloidosis

Amyloidosis refers to a group of rare diseases caused by abnormal protein deposits (called amyloid) building up in organs and tissues. These misfolded proteins disrupt normal body functions, leading to serious health complications.

What is Amyloid?

Amyloid forms when proteins in the body misfold, clump together, and deposit in different organs. As amyloid builds up, it can lead to organ damage and reduced quality of life.

Symptoms

Symptoms vary based on the type of amyloidosis and which organs are affected. Common general symptoms include:
	•	Fatigue
	•	Weight loss
	•	Swelling in legs/ankles
	•	Shortness of breath
	•	Numbness or tingling in hands/feet

Symptoms can often resemble other conditions, leading to delayed diagnosis.

Types of Amyloidosis

Each type is named with “A” followed by the protein responsible. For example:
	•	AL Amyloidosis (from light chain proteins)
	•	ATTR Amyloidosis (from transthyretin protein)
	•	AA, ALECT2, Aβ2M, and other rare forms

⸻

AL Amyloidosis
	•	Caused by abnormal plasma cells producing light chains that form amyloid.
	•	Often diagnosed after age 50; affects both men and women.
	•	Related to multiple myeloma (10-15% overlap).

Key Symptoms
	•	Leg swelling
	•	Fatigue
	•	Irregular heartbeat
	•	Enlarged tongue
	•	Skin changes (bruising, purple patches around eyes)

Diagnosis
	•	Tissue biopsy
	•	Blood/urine tests for light chains
	•	Bone marrow biopsy
	•	Imaging tests (ECG, MRI, echocardiogram)

Treatment
	•	Target abnormal plasma cells with:
	•	Chemotherapy
	•	Steroids
	•	Proteasome inhibitors
	•	Monoclonal antibodies
	•	Stem cell transplant (in select cases)
	•	Supportive care to manage symptoms and organ function

ATTR Amyloidosis

Caused by abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein. Two forms:
	•	Hereditary (hATTR): Inherited mutations in TTR gene
	•	Wild-type (ATTRwt): Develops with age, usually affects the heart

Hereditary ATTR (hATTR)
	•	Caused by over 120 TTR mutations
	•	Common mutations:
	•	pV50M: Portugal, Sweden, Japan
	•	pV142I: African descent
	•	pT80A: Irish descent

Symptoms
	•	Heart issues: palpitations, fainting, fatigue
	•	Nerve issues: numbness, walking difficulty
	•	GI symptoms: nausea, weight loss

Diagnosis
	•	Genetic testing for TTR mutations
	•	Biopsies, imaging (MRI, scans), and protein testing

Treatment
	•	TTR stabilizers: Tafamidis (Vyndaqel), Acoramidis (Attruby)
	•	Gene silencers: Patisiran (Onpattro), Vutrisiran (Amvuttra)
	•	Supportive care: For symptoms and organ protection

Wild-Type ATTR (ATTRwt)
	•	Non-inherited; develops with age
	•	Primarily affects men over 60
	•	Often causes heart failure and carpal tunnel syndrome

Diagnosis & Treatment

Same as hATTR, with emphasis on TTR stabilizers and supportive care.

Rare Types of Amyloidosis

AA Amyloidosis
	•	Linked to long-standing inflammation or infections
	•	Mostly affects kidneys
	•	Treat underlying disease to reduce SAA protein

ALECT2 Amyloidosis
	•	More common in people of Mexican, Punjabi, Native American, and Middle Eastern descent
	•	Often underdiagnosed
	•	Mainly affects kidneys, also liver and spleen

Aβ2M Amyloidosis
	•	Seen in long-term dialysis patients
	•	Affects bones and joints
	•	Becoming rarer due to improved dialysis techniques

Apolipoprotein Amyloidosis
	•	Hereditary
	•	Caused by unstable cholesterol transport proteins (e.g., ApoA-I, ApoA-II)
	•	Affects heart, kidneys, and nerves

Fibrinogen (AFib), Gelsolin (AGel), and Lysozyme (ALys) Amyloidosis
	•	Inherited
	•	Affect kidneys, nerves, skin, or glands
	•	Currently no specific treatments; supportive care and research ongoing

⸻

Diagnostic Tools Summary
	•	Biopsies (tissue, bone marrow)
	•	Blood and urine analysis
	•	Imaging: ECG, MRI, echocardiograms
	•	Genetic testing (for hereditary types)
	•	Specialized testing: mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry

⸻

Treatment Overview

Main Approaches
	•	Stabilizing the abnormal protein (e.g., Tafamidis)
	•	Gene silencing (e.g., Vutrisiran, Patisiran)
	•	Chemotherapy & plasma cell targeting (for AL)
	•	Organ support & symptom management

Note: Treatments depend on the amyloidosis type, stage of disease, and patient health.

⸻

Additional Notes
	•	Early diagnosis is critical for better outcomes
	•	Genetic counseling recommended for families with hereditary amyloidosis
	•	Ongoing clinical trials may offer access to emerging therapies
